      <description>Introduction The purpose of this article is very simple. Just run a gRPC example in different Docker containers. Since it really costed me a lot of time, I&amp;rsquo;d like to keep records here.
Docker is a very useful container tool, which can be considered as a light virtualization technique comparing to traditional virtual machine tools such as Virtualbox, VMware, etc. For more details about the differences between them, as well as the Docker&amp;rsquo;s basics, please refer this Stack Overflow question, the Digital Ocean tutorial, or the Docker official introduction.</description>
